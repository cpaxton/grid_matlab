% DATA COLLECTION SCRIPT FOR NN LEARNING
%   Generates a large number of levels in different environments.
%   Uses the params that we get as a result to train neural nets for each
%   high-level option we may want to perform.
%   We learn the parameters of the motion primitive, parameterized by the
%   input of features and associated time.
