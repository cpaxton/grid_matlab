This implementation is specially well suited for evolutionary approaches

since the entire network is represented as a vector from which then the 
weights matcies
are extracted.






There is a simple demo program called Test.m

so

type:

>> Tess <enter> "to see an example running"

or 

type:
>> edit Test.m <enter> "to see the code of the example program"


This implementation is fast, easy to follow, and nice !!!


Enjoy it !!!.
